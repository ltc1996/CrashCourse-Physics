{\move(1100,706,190,706)}Resistors, batteries, and capacitors – these are just a few of the tools you use to build circuits, and provide power to the world around us.
{\pos(640,658)}电阻 电池和电容只是构成电路的一些元件

{\move(1200,706,70,706)}Today, we're going to build some basic circuits out of resistors and batteries to figure out how they react and change, depending on their configuration.
{\pos(640,658)}这次课 我们从简单的纯电阻电路开始

{\pos(640,658)}看看不同的电阻值和电压值会对电路有什么影响

For instance, in this circuit, I've got a battery connected to a light bulb.
例如 在这个电路中 有一个灯泡被接在电池两端

Easy enough, right?
很简单 对吧

{\move(1200,706,100,706)}The battery provides a voltage, generating a current that runs through the whole circuit, lighting up our connected light bulb due to its resistance.
{\pos(640,658)}电池提供了电压 并产生贯穿整个电路的电流

{\pos(640,658)}灯泡中的电阻流过电流被而点亮

Now, what if you have two identical light bulbs in a row?
如果你现在将两个相同的灯泡头尾相接

How will the current change?
电路中的电流会如何变化呢

How bright will each one be?
每个灯泡会有多亮

{\move(1100,706,150,706)}And what if, instead of two identical light bulbs on the same wire, you place the second bulb on its own wire that connects to the battery?
{\pos(640,658)}如果不是头尾相接

{\pos(640,658)}而是将两个灯泡都接在电池两端呢

{\move(1200,706,60,706)}These are all basic DC, or direct current circuits, made up of batteries and resistors with current flowing constantly out of the battery in one direction.
{\pos(640,658)}这种是最基本的直流（DC）电路 只包含电池和电阻

{\pos(640,658)}电池提供恒定的单向电流

{\move(950,706,320,706)}We'll talk about currents that aren't so constant later on, but for now, everything we deal with will be a DC circuit.
{\pos(640,658)}不恒定的电流以后再谈 现在我们研究的默认是直流电路

{\move(750,706,520,706)}And hopefully, once we're through, these bulbs here won't be the only ones lighting up!
{\pos(640,658)}我希望课上完以后 “充电”的不只是灯泡

Let's start our anatomy of a circuit lesson with our source of energy: the battery.
我们来分析一下电能的来源 电池

{\move(1100,706,210,706)}An ideal battery provides a constant voltage to a circuit, powered by its conversion of stored chemical energy to electrical energy.
{\pos(640,658)}理想的电池将储存其中的化学能转化为电能 来为电路提供恒定电压

{\move(1450,706,-150,706)}Scientists say that the battery is a source of electromotive force, because it gets charge to move – but it's not really providing a force, but rather a difference in electrical potential.
{\pos(640,658)}科学家们认为 电荷移动产生电压

{\pos(640,658)}但它并不提供真正的压力 而是提供电压的差值

So we shorten this to say that the ideal voltage supplied by the battery is its emf.
所以简单来说这个差值就是它的电动势

Ideally, the battery uses all of its voltage to power the devices in a circuit.
电池在理想情况下的全部电压都会向电路中的器件供电

But, like most things in real life, batteries aren't perfect.
但人无完人 电池也不例外

{\move(1200,706,70,706)}While a battery's purpose is to provide a steady voltage, its inner workings still contain conductive materials that will naturally lose energy as heat.
{\pos(640,658)}虽然电池的初衷是提供稳定的电压

{\pos(640,658)}电池内部仍然包含导电材料 供电时会发热而消耗能量

{\move(740,706,550,706)}Like when you watch Crash Course on your phone for three hours and it gets warm.
{\pos(640,658)}就像你学了三个小时速成课后 手机发烫一样

{\move(1700,706,-430,706)}That heat is partly caused by the components inside the battery having resistance, and you know that when there's resistance in a flow of current, power will be drawn and released – often in the form of heat.
{\pos(640,658)}这种热量有部分是由电池内部电阻元件产生的

{\pos(640,658)}并且我们知道 当电流流过电阻时

{\pos(640,658)}能量通常以发热的形式释放

{\move(780,706,490,706)}In a circuit, you model this effect as an internal resistance between the battery's terminals.
{\pos(640,658)}在电路中 我们将这种情况定义为电池存在内阻

{\move(1100,706,170,706)}So, when you measure the actual voltage between the terminals of the battery, you get a value that's less than our ideal emf potential.
{\pos(640,658)}所以当你测量电池两端的实际电压时 会得到一个小于理想电动势的值

This real voltage is called the terminal voltage.
这个实际电压被称为路端电压

{\move(1250,706,10,706)}And you calculate the terminal voltage by subtracting the voltage drop due to internal resistance from the supplied emf voltage, designated by a script E.
{\pos(640,658)}路端电压等于电动势减去电源内阻的分压

{\move(1000,706,280,706)}This internal voltage drop, according to Ohm's law, is equal to the current through the circuit times the internal resistance.
{\pos(640,658)}根据欧姆定律 电源的分压等于电路的电流乘上电源内阻

{\move(1350,706,-120,706)}The internal resistance is typically much smaller than the resistance of any connected devices, so the terminal voltage is usually only a little bit less than the emf voltage.
{\pos(640,658)}内阻通常比任何连进电路的设备中的电阻都要小得多

{\pos(640,658)}所以路端电压通常只比电动势稍微小一点点

{\move(1150,706,210,706)}For example, say you have a 12 Volt battery with no internal resistance, and it's connected in a circuit with a resistor of 100 Ohms.
{\pos(640,658)}假设有一个无内阻的12V电池 两端接上一个100Ω的电阻

You can use Ohm's Law to find that the resulting current is 0.120 Amperes.
可以使用欧姆定律求出电流是0.120A

Now, let's say that the battery has an internal resistance of 1 Ohm.
现在假设电池的内阻为1Ω

{\move(1450,706,-210,706)}If you substitute Ohm's law into our equation for terminal voltage and solve the equation with both the internal resistance and the resistance of the circuit it's hooked up to,
{\pos(640,658)}然后用欧姆定律 代入路端电压的表达式求解电流

you find that the current through the circuit is now 0.119 Amperes.
你会发现现在的电流是0.119A

Compared to the ideal battery, it's only a 1 Milliampere difference.
与理想电池仅有1毫安的差异

{\move(1250,706,100,706)}Now, to find out exactly how much power is lost to the battery's internal resistance, you can use the power expression we used in our last lesson:
{\pos(640,658)}利用上节课讲的能量表达式 可以算出电源内阻消耗的能量

power equals current times voltage.
能量等于电流乘上电压

{\move(1250,706,0,706)}Because, that equation shows the rate at which energy is converted from electricity into another form of energy, such as heat, light, or mechanical power.
{\pos(640,658)}这个表达式体现了能量以何种形式转化 是热能 光能还是机械能

{\move(1300,706,0,706)}But since we don't know the voltage drop across the internal resistance, you can use Ohm's law, and substitute "current times resistance" for the voltage.
{\pos(640,658)}内阻的分压未知 但根据欧姆定律 可以将分压替换为“电流×内阻”

{\move(1000,706,280,706)}From this equation, you can see that the internal resistance causes the battery to use about 14 milliWatts of power.
{\pos(640,658)}从这个等式中可以看出 内阻损耗了约14mW的能量

{\move(1340,706,-20,706)}Now, you might have noticed in this example, that while the two resistance values were different, the current going throughout the whole circuit was the same.
{\pos(640,658)}你可能注意到了 两个电阻值虽然不同 但整个电路中的电流是相同的

{\move(1400,706,-120,706)}When at least two resistors are connected along the same path, they're connected in series, and any devices connected in series have the same current flowing through them.
{\pos(640,658)}电阻头尾相接 我们称为串联排列

{\pos(640,658)}而流过串联排列的任何元件具有相同的电流值

{\move(1060,706,220,706)}And while all resistors along the same wire have the same current, they each have different voltages dropping across them.
{\pos(640,658)}虽然同一根导线上电流相等 但不同的电阻具有不同的电压

{\move(1200,706,80,706)}According to the conservation of energy, the total voltage supplied to the system is equal to the sum of all the voltage drops across the circuit.
{\pos(640,658)}根据能量守恒 系统的总电压等于电路中所有元件的电压之和

{\move(860,706,370,706)}Think of it as a river, like we've done before, with each resistor as a group of rocks sitting in the water.
{\pos(640,658)}想像电流是一条河 每个电阻都是水里的岩石

{\move(1390,706,-170,706)}The current will be the same going through each set of rocks, whether it's a pile of large boulders, with high resistance, or a clump of small pebbles, with low resistance.
{\pos(640,658)}经过每个石头的水流都是相同的 无论是大石头(大电阻)还是小石子(小电阻)

{\move(890,706,370,706)}Since it's much easier for current to go through small pebbles, the energy spent going through them is low.
{\pos(640,658)}但通过小石头要容易得多 因此损耗的能量低

And for large boulders, which offer higher resistance, more energy will be lost.
而大石头 阻力更大需要的能量也更多

And this change in potential energy is just like a voltage drop.
这种势能的变化和电压一样

{\move(1090,706,220,706)}For the same current, the voltage drop across greater resistances is higher than the lower voltage drops for the low resistances.
{\pos(640,658)}电流相同时 电阻越大电压越高

But let's figure out how to express this mathematically.
让我们想想怎么用数学式表示

{\move(1400,706,-80,706)}If the voltage supplied by a battery is the equal to the sum of all voltage drops across, say, three resistors in a series, you can substitute Ohm's law for each resistor.
{\pos(640,658)}如果电源提供的电压等于所有元件 比如三个串联电阻的电压之和

{\pos(640,658)}你可以用欧姆定律改写每个电阻的电压式

The voltage drop across each resistor is proportional to its resistance.
每个电阻上的电压与电阻成正比

{\move(1300,706,-7,706)}Also, since the current is equal for all of the components, you can represent the total resistance of the circuit as the sum of all the resistances in the series.
{\pos(640,658)}而且 由于所有元件的电流相等

{\pos(640,658)}你可以将串联电路的总电阻表示为所有电阻的和

This total is called the equivalent resistance.
这个值被称为等效电阻

{\move(1100,706,177,706)}Now there's another way you can combine resistors in a circuit – by splitting one path of current into two or more branches.
{\pos(640,658)}还有另一种排列电阻的方法 将一个电路分成两个或更多支路

{\move(1200,706,-7,706)}When multiple resistors are configured so the current splits into many branches from a single source, they're said to be connected in parallel.
{\pos(640,658)}电阻将电路分成多个分支的排列方式 称为并联

{\move(1100,706,170,706)}And in the case of parallel connection, you want to pay close attention to the principle known as the conservation of charge.
{\pos(640,658)}在并联的情况下 你要密切关注电荷守恒原则

{\move(1200,706,120,706)}This principle states that all current flowing to the junction where the path splits, equals all of the current flowing out of the same junction.
{\pos(640,658)}电荷守恒规定 干路电流等于其他支路的电流之和

That's to say that what goes in must come out!
这就是 说进去多少就得出来多少

{\move(1000,706,300,706)}Now, for each of these branches, the amount of current passing through it depends on its respective resistance.
{\pos(640,658)}而每个分支的电流大小 取决于各自具有的电阻大小

{\move(980,706,290,706)}And since you no longer have a single current throughout your whole circuit, charge is not limited to one path.
{\pos(640,658)}由于整个电路的电流被分成多束 电荷能走的路径也不唯一了

So, let's think about this again in terms of flowing water.
那让我们再来想像水流的模型

{\move(1380,706,-150,706)}If a river breaks off into two different branches, and there's one branch with lots of resistance and another with very little, where do you think most of the water will go?
{\pos(640,658)}如果一条河流分成两个分支 一个分支阻力很大

{\pos(640,658)}而另一个分支组里很小 你认为大部分的水会从哪条路流过

The path of least resistance!
肯定是走最省劲的路线

Not all of the water goes down the easy way.
但并不是所有的水滴都能如愿的

There's still water that moves through the rocky branch, but just not as much.
仍然有少量的水流通过阻力大的分支

{\move(1180,706,100,706)}And in our hypothetical river, both branches, no matter how rocky, start and end at the same elevation, giving them the same potential.
{\pos(640,658)}在我们想象出的河流中 无论分支多么陡峭

{\pos(640,658)}都在同一高度开始分叉 最后汇聚在一处 具有相同的势能(电动势)

{\move(1180,706,100,706)}In terms of electricity, this means that for every branch in a parallel connection, the voltage is the same, no matter what the resistance is.
{\pos(640,658)}在并联电路中的每个分支 无论电阻是多少都拥有相等的电压

{\move(850,706,400,706)}So, for a series connection, the current is the same for all resistors, and the voltage drop changes.
{\pos(640,658)}因此对于串联的电阻 电流相同而电压不同

{\move(900,706,397,706)}But in a parallel connection, the voltage is the same for all resistors, and the current through each changes.
{\pos(640,658)}而并联电阻的电压相同 电流不同

{\move(900,706,400,706)}Now, remember how you add up all the resistances to find an equivalent resistance for resistors in a series?
{\pos(640,658)}还记得怎么算串联电阻的等效电阻吗

Would the same be true for a parallel setup?
并联时也是这样求吗

Let's look at this mathematically to find out.
让我们来从数学上证明一下

{\move(1000,706,300,706)}Conservation of charge says that the current in the wire before the split junction is equal to the current coming out.
{\pos(640,658)}电荷守恒告诉我们 干路电流等于其他支路的电流之和

So if we've got three branches, the current goes in three directions.
所以如果我们有三个分支 电流就会有三个流向

{\move(900,706,400,706)}We can substitute Ohm's law for each current to get an equation in terms of voltage and resistance.
{\pos(640,658)}我们可以用欧姆定律消掉电流 得到关于电压和电阻的方程

{\move(1500,706,-300,706)}And since the voltage for each resistor is the same in parallel, you can cancel the voltage term out of the entire equation and we're left with the equation for parallel equivalent resistance.
{\pos(640,658)}约掉并联电阻相同的电压 得到并联电阻的等效电阻表达式

{\move(1200,706,100,706)}This shows you that the equivalent resistance for a parallel setup of resistors will actually be smaller than any one of the resistors in the circuit.
{\pos(640,658)}这个公式表明 并联电阻的等效电阻小于任何一个电阻

And this kind of makes sense, if you think back to our river analogy!
回想起我们的水流模型 你会发现这种说法是有道理的

{\move(1350,706,-140,706)}Even if one of the two branches in a river is very clogged up, there's still more current flowing through the total system than if that clogged up branch did not exist.
{\pos(640,658)}即使其中一个支路阻力极大

{\pos(640,658)}整体流速也要比只有一个分支时要大

{\move(1250,706,40,706)}So any additional branch will serve to decrease the total resistance of the system, and increase the amount of current through the entire circuit.
{\pos(640,658)}因此 加入任何支路都会减小系统的总电阻 提高通过整个电路的电流

{\move(1550,706,-340,706)}All right, now that we've learned what series and parallel connections are, let's go back to those circuits we talked about at the beginning, and see what happens when you connect them for real.
{\pos(640,658)}好了 现在我们已经学会了如何分析电阻的串联和并联

{\pos(640,658)}让我们回头看那个一开始提过的电路 看看实际情况是什么样

{\move(750,706,500,706)}When you connect a single light bulb to our battery, you see how it lights up brightly.
{\pos(640,658)}当你将一个灯泡连进电路时 灯泡是这个量度

Now what happens when you add an identical light bulb in a series connection?
现在串联一个相同的灯泡以后 量度会如何变化

{\move(950,706,340,706)}Since identical light bulbs have identical resistances, you know that the resistance in the circuit would be double.
{\pos(640,658)}因为相同的灯泡点阻相同 所以总电阻会增加一倍

And this corresponds to a current that'shalf of what it would be for a single bulb.
每个灯泡的电流相当于原来的一半

{\move(1050,706,140,706)}And sure enough, once you complete the circuit, you can see that the bulbs are less bright than the original, single-bulb circuit.
{\pos(640,658)}接上第二个灯泡后 你会发现两个灯泡都变暗了

{\move(1000,706,240,706)}And if you added more bulbs in series, you'd see that the brightness would keep decreasing for each additional bulb.
{\pos(640,658)}如果添加了更多灯泡 你会发现每个灯泡将变得更暗

{\move(1350,706,-40,706)}Now, let's take our single-bulb circuit and add one bulb in a parallel connection, so the current splits into two different branches, each with equal resistance.
{\pos(640,658)}现在 我们来给原始电路并联上一个灯泡

{\pos(640,658)}电流因此分成两个分支 每个分支电阻相等

Now you see that each bulb is the same brightness as the single-bulb circuit!
现在你会发现 两个灯泡的亮度没有变化

So, why is that?
这是为什么呢

{\move(1350,706,-40,706)}Well, in this setup, the current has an additional – but identical – path to go through, so the overall resistance is half of what it was with a single-wire circuit.
{\pos(640,658)}这两个支路的电阻相同 所以总电阻是原来的一半

{\move(1200,706,40,706)}Since the equivalent resistance is half of what it used to be, and the voltage hasn't changed, the current increases to double its original value.
{\pos(640,658)}等效电阻是原来的一半 且电压不变 那么电流增加到原来的两倍

{\move(1550,706,-340,706)}But since the current must divide equally into each of the different paths, we're left with two bulbs that have the same amount of current flowing through them that the single bulb circuit had!
{\pos(640,658)}但是电流必须平均分配给所有支路

{\pos(640,658)}而两个灯泡的电阻一样 因此他们平分两倍的电流

This is incredibly useful.
这一点非常有用

{\move(1250,706,0,706)}Think about the outlets in your house – they're all connected in parallel, so no matter how many items are plugged in, they all receive the same voltage.
{\pos(640,658)}想想你家的插座 它们都是并联连接的

{\pos(640,658)}所以无论插入多少电器 它们电压都是一样的

{\move(850,706,340,706)}But! What happens when you create circuits that are combinations of series and parallel connections?
{\pos(640,658)}但串联与并联混合使用时电路时什么样呢

{\move(1650,706,-440,706)}We've already got the tools to solve most circuit arrangements that you'll encounter, so next time we'll look at some key examples, mathematically and electrically, so don't forget to bring your light bulbs!
{\pos(640,658)}我们已经学会了分析大部分电路

{\pos(640,658)}下次我们将在理论与实践上分析几个典型例子 不要忘记带上你的灯泡哦

{\move(1050,706,240,706)}Today we learned about batteries, and how terminal voltage results from the natural internal resistance of every real battery.
{\pos(640,658)}今天我们讲了电源 它的内阻以及路端电压

{\move(1150,706,120,706)}We discussed both series and parallel circuit configurations, and how the laws of conservation affect the current and voltage for each.
{\pos(640,658)}我们讨论了串联和并联电路 并用守恒定律分析了电流与电压

{\move(950,706,340,706)}Finally, we saw how series and parallel connections affect real circuits in our light bulb circuit demonstration.
{\pos(640,658)}最后 实验演示了串联和并联对灯泡亮度的实际影响
